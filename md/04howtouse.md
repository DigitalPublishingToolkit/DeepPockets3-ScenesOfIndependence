# How to Use This Book?

This book consists of several differently themed parts. It is the
personal story of a journey between Amsterdam and Zagreb, a genealogy of
Zagreb’s independent cultural scene, a mapping of cores of criticality
in Zagreb today, a search for futurologies, a critique of the notion of
independence, and a theory of the scene. This manual is written to
assist you in deciding what to read first or foremost. If you do not
feel like being guided, it is recommended to disregard this manual and
to start and stop reading wherever.

The *Preface* is an excellent synopsis of the book’s argumentation by
one of Croatia’s leading art historians, Leonida Kovač.

The *Introduction* is a mapping exercise which outlines a basic
understanding of independent culture in Zagreb. Closing off this
exercise, I position myself as a researcher and explicate the goal of my
writing.

The main text of the book consists of three parts. If the first two
parts focus mostly on organization, formation, positionality and
politics, the latter part is concerned with formulation and theory.

The first part, *Genealogy,* is a historical account of independent
cultures. Its central question is: how are independent cultures born?
Based on interviews, participatory research, and (archival) literature
research, I trace the birth of independent cultures to the point zero of
1991 and distinguish three subsequent stages after that. The distinction
of these phases are propositions towards a genealogy of praxis, in the
Foucauldian sense, which tries to understand how new social
constellations are born every time the hand of power redistributes the
playing cards of life.

In the following part, *Today,* I discuss – freely, speculatively, and
in solidarity – the current, lived condition of independent cultures
and the struggles around civil society. In some sense, it narrates the
fourth and, so far, last phase of independent cultures, but, at the same
time, it connects the past to the future through the present and
conjures the question: whose independent cultures are these? It could
function as an opening up of the conversation with the scene in Zagreb,
its practitioners, and its historians, and it sets the stage for the
next and more theoretical part of the book*.*

Part three, *Dimensions of Independence,* is the theoretical core of the
book. It addresses the central question: what independence is at stake
in independent cultures? It is a proposition towards an aesthetic theory
of independence as a renewed notion of critical culture, based on the
embrace of untranslatability and the scene as regime in common/s.
